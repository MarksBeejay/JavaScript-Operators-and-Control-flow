(i) Arithmetic Operators; 
let x = 4
let y = 2
console.log(x + y); result = 6
console.log(x - y); result = 2

(ii) Assignment operators
let x = 10
console.log(x); result is 10
console.log(x += 5); result is 15

(iii) Comparison Operators
let x = 1
console.log (x > 1); result is true
console.log (x < 1); result is false

(iv) Logical Operators
let age = true
let nationality = true
let eligibleToVote = age && nationality
console.log(eligibleToVote); result is true

let age = true
let nationality = false
let eligibleToVote = age || nationality
console.log(eligibleToVote); result is true

(v) Bitwise operators
let z = 5 & 1;
console.log(z); result is 1
let z = 5 | 1;
console.log(z); result is 1

4. for (let i = 1; i < 20; i+=7) {
    console.log(i);
}
result is 1, 8, 15.
